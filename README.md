# GEOGRAPHY 458: Lab 2 by Ryan Danao

**Introduction:**

In this lab, I will make use of the geo-tagged twitter data by collected them from two different locations and comparing them from one another. Furthermore, I will compare them using two methods. One way of comparison I plan to make use of is by making a map through QGIS. The second way of comparison would be through images of word clouds. More specifically, I chose to compare data covered around the United States as compared to data covered in the Philippines. I chose these two countries because the Philippines is my home, as I grew up there. Moreover, I am interested in comparing data from back home to where I am situated now. Overall, I have spent a good amount of time in both countries, which makes this lab more meaningful to me. 

**Maps:**

Map 1 represents geospatial patterns of geo-tagged tweets around the US while map 2 portrays similar data but in a completely different country, the Philippines. Based on the patterns, it is clear that there is much more data made available that comes from the United States as compared to the results found from the entire Philippines. This goes to show how many more active users there are in the United States as compared to the Philippines as well. 

**Word Clouds:**

![cloud 2](C:\Users\14159\ryandanaolab2.github.io\img\Word Art 1 for second run.png)

The first world cloud represents different words used and found in the multiple tweets found when the United States was filtered as the location. Moreover, the second word cloud shows the results when the Philippines was selected and filtered. There are clear differences in the words in each cloud, as you can see some Tagalog words used in cloud 2 while cloud 1 shows a larger set of words. This makes sense as the results that came from the United States was significantly more than that of from the Philippines.
